# risk-checker-core

This repository is a core design space for a risk-checking system.

The goal is not to judge people,
but to detect critical risk signals early
and return decisions to humans.

This repository prioritizes:
- safety over optimization
- structure over individual judgment
- prevention over blame

## Non-goals (Important)
This project does NOT:
- provide medical diagnosis or severity scoring
- replace clinical judgment or local protocols
- evaluate or rank people
- justify punishment or blame using “risk”
